## Inspiration
Recently one of our teammates was talking to their neighbor who is an older gentleman and he was telling them how the usual person who comes to care for him and help out with chores had gotten the coronavirus and would not be able to come to help for quite some time. While discussing this is when the idea of this project came to us like an epiphany. Especially given the delicate conditions in our current times we thought of providing a portal of sorts for older people to reach out to people who will help them get through this difficult time.

## What it does
Our project connects older people to people who are willing to help them in everyday tasks like cooking and cleaning as well as in case of a requirement of nursing for a nominal fee. This benefits both the person in need of some help as well the person who wishes to make a difference and help out someone for a small fee. It also has a button on opening which can be pressed to immediately call an ambulance in case of emergency. We have also provided options for the selection of the gender of the helper as some people may have a preference with that respect.

## How we built it
We used whatever knowledge we had as beginners  and  put a lot of thought into the process and took the best suited decision at each stage. Though we faced certain problems which seemed off putting at first we managed to find solutions for them all and are proud of our final product. 

## Challenges we ran into
This was the first hackathon for 2 out of 3 of our team members and we struggled to put things together ourselves but we eventually pushed through. Another problem was ensuring the UI is as simple as possible in order to not complicate things much considering that our project targets older people as a major portion of the application.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of having been able to implement this vision and make it into a reality. The UI is simple and effective but does the job perfectly. There is an immense pride that comes with creating something that will help multiple people who we could not have been able to reach to if it had not been for this application. 

## What we learned
We learnt how to implement a server and store and retrieve data from the same. We also learnt how to implement various different components in our frontend. Another important aspect was to work together as a team and tackle all the obstacles thrown at us.

## What's next for Helping Hand
We would have liked to implement a feature which checks a user's location and provides the details of the nearest helpers based on their location and also an online payment portal.
